1. Child: any person under 15 years of age, unless the minimum age for work or mandatory schooling is higher by local law, in which case the stipulated higher age applies in that locality 
2. Child labour: any work performed by a child younger than the age(s) specified in the above definition of a child, except as provided for by ILO recommendation 146*. 
3. Remediation of child labourers: all support and actions necessary to ensure the safety, health, education and development of children who have been subjected to child labour, as defined above, and whose work has been terminated. 
The ILO Minimum Age Convention 138 (1973) and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention 182 (1999) are the two cornerstones addressing issues with regards to child labor.
*Convention 138 with Recommendation 146 allows some developing countries to set a minimum age for general employment at 14 and a minimum age for light work at 12

Further guidance provided by SA 8000: 
The organisation may employ young workers, but where such young workers are subject to compulsory education laws, they shall work only outside of school hours. Under no circumstances shall any young worker’s school, work and transportation time exceed a combined total of 10 hours per day, and in no case shall young workers work more than 8 hours a day. Young workers may not work during night hours. The organisation shall not expose young workers to any situations – in or outside of the workplace – that are hazardous or unsafe to their physical and mental health and development. 
Also see SA 8000 Guidance on Apprenticeship or on-the-job training programs:
Organisations must ensure that any such programs do not in any way abuse the rights of young workers. Young workers cannot be paid less than adults for the same type and amount of work. The organisation should maintain accurate payroll records to ensure that young workers receive equal pay for equal work. Any apprenticeship schemes should be for a defined period of time with structured oversight by, or registration with, a government agency, or by an alternative competent and credible authority where government registration and oversight is not required. In countries where local laws permit the payment of stipends or lower pay during an apprenticeship period or training program, the organisation must ensure that it meets the specific conditions of the law and has systems in place to ensure the protection of young workers’ rights. Apprenticeship schemes should not be used for extended periods of time to substitute for full-time work.";;;;"[O62]"
